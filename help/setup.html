				<a href="https://pccommander.net/">PC Commander</a> skill and 
				Pushbullet.&nbsp; </strong>This set-up provides maximum 
				versatility as it supports the use variable expressions - 
				meaning you can say a phrase that doesn't need to be fully 
				pre-determined.&nbsp; For example, you could say "Alexa, tell my

				This set-ups also provides maximum versatility as it too supports the 
				use variable expressions.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, you need to 
				include a slight pause after the trigger phrase, for example you 
				could say "Siri, tell my computer to" (pause for a few seconds

          </table>Now, a few words about the use of
		  PCCommander, IFTTT, Dropbox, Pushbullet and/or Pushover in conjunction 
		  Push2Run ...<br><br>All services are quite reliable and have many features going beyond those needed in support of Push2Run.<br>
		  <br>IFTTT offers both free and paid subscription plans; here is where 
		  you can find more information about that:&nbsp;
		  <a href="https://ifttt.com/plans">https://ifttt.com/plans</a> .&nbsp; 
		  Also, at one point IFTTT was able to work with Google in such a way that 
		  variable text was supported.&nbsp; Sadly, however this was 
		  discontinued by Google in September 2022.&nbsp; The result of this is 
		  where it once was that only one IFTTT applet was required for most, 
		  if not all the needs of Push2Run, now one specific applet is need for 
		  each specific action you would like Push2Run to take.&nbsp; <br><br>PC 
		  Commander is an Alexa skill specifically designed to work hand in hand 
		  with Pushbullet to trigger Push2Run.&nbsp; Using Alexa, PC Commander, 
		  Pushbullet and Push2Run you can execute a wide range of tasks on your 
		  Windows computer using simple voice commands. Whether youâ€™re looking 
		  to open applications, control media playback or manage system 
		  settings, using PC Commander provides an excellent, user-friendly and 
		  efficient way to enhance your home automation setup.&nbsp; PC commanders 
		  offers 150 free uses a month, but also a paid subscription if you need 
		  more. <br><br>Here 
		  too is a recap of the Dropbox, Pushbullet and Pushover services, with some key differences as they relate to their use with Push2Run:<br>

                <strong>Misc. Notes:<br><br>A. For all Apple iPhone/iPad set ups:<br><br></strong>Please also see '<a href="everything.html">Using 
				Everything</a>' for optional intergration with the Everything 
		  freeware file search utility<strong>.<br><br>B. For all set ups involving 
		  IFTTT:<br><br></strong>As of September 2020 it's is possible to set up Push2Run to use one, two or three of the Dropbox, Pushbullet and Pushover services in conjunction with IFTTT.&nbsp; However, for this you will require a subscription to <a href="https://ifttt.com/plans">IFTTT's Pro service</a>.<br>
                <br>
                IFTTT's Pro service provides for several advantages, but in particular for use with Push2Run it allows the triggering of more than one action.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                The reason you might want to do this is for redundancy.&nbsp; For example, if one of Dropbox, Pushbullet or Pushover was down or responding slowly, triggered actions would still flow through the other two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                Push2Run has built in logic to ignore multiple triggered actions for the same thing. So, in short, Push2Run works the same with or without redundant services, however it is more reliable with redundant services enabled.<br>
                <br>
                To set up an IFTTT Pro applet just follow the instructions above for setting up a Dropbox, Pushbullet, or Pushover applet. Once done, add either one or two of the other services as additional actions.&nbsp; Please refer to the 
		  set up instructions above for the details on how to set up each service.<br>
				<br>** currently there seems to be an issue with IFTTT and 
				Google such that newly entered IFTTT applets may not work 
				unless you go into the Google Home app on your phone and relink 
				the IFTTT service. To do this, when you are in your Google Home 
				app, tap on the '+' sign at the top right of the screen, tap on 
				'Set up device', tap on 'Works with Google', tap on 'IFTTT', tap 
				on Reconnect account', tap on 'Continue', after which time you 
				can leave the Google Home app. **<br><br><strong>C. For all set ups 
				involving Google Assistant device:</strong><br><br>In working 
				with my Google Assistant device and IFTTT, I found a way to say 
				"OK Google, do something" instead of "OK Google, activate do 
				something" and have it work. <br><br>If you would like to do 
				this too, then to get this to work go into the Google Home app 
				on your phone, tap the 'Routines' icon, tap the colourful '+' 
				sign in the bottom right of the screen, tap 'Add Starter', tap 
				'When I say to Google Assistant', enter phase you are working 
				with but do not include the word 'activate' - for example "open 
				the calculator" (without the quotes), tap 'Add starter', tap 
				'Add Action', tap 'Try adding your own', enter the same phase as 
				above but this time be sure to include the 'activate' at the 
				beginning of it - for example "activate open the calculator" 
				(without the quotes), tap 'Done'. <br><br>Of note, with the 
				above Google will not respond with a confirmation. If you would 
				like to also hear a confirmation, then tap on 'Add action', tap 
				on 'Communicate and announce', tap on the check box beside 'Make 
				an announcement, tap on the option 'Announce on the device that 
				started the routine', enter whatever you want in 'Your Message' 
				- for example "OK, opening the calculator", tap on the check 
				symbol at the top right of the screen, tap 'Save', tap 'Done'.
				<br><br>Tap 'Save', and leave the Google Home app. <br><br>After 
				that, I can say "OK Google, open the calculator" and it will 
				work. <br>&nbsp;
