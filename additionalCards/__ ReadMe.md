# Push2Run Additional Cards

This directory contains additional cards that you can import into Push2Run.

To import a card, just download the .p2r card from this directory to your computer and then with Push2Run running, double click on the downloaded .p2r file you want to import.

Of note: some cards require programs that you may not have already installed on your computer.  
Two examples of this are:
- Cast ( which you can get from [here](https://github.com/roblatour/cast) )
- Setvol (which you can get from [here](https://github.com/roblatour/setvol) )

Always manually example a card that you are importing to be exactly sure what it is doing.

From Github you can click on any of the .p2r files in this directory to see what they contain.
