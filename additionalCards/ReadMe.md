# Push2Run Additional Cards

This directory contains additional cards that you can import into Push2Run.

Of note: some cards require programs that you may not have already installed on your computer.  
Two examples of this are:
- Cast ( which you can get from [here](https://github.com/roblatour/cast) )
- Setvol (which you can get from [here](https://github.com/roblatour/setvol) )

Always manually examine a card that you are importing to be exactly sure what it is doing.

From Github you can click on any of the .p2r files in this directory (usually to the in a directory list to the left of this ReadMe file on Github) to see what they contain.  Once done, you can click on the Github Download Raw icon (usually near the top right on Github) to download the file itself.

To import the .p2r card you have downloaded, with Push2Run running, just double click on the downloaded .p2r file.<br><br>Once done click either 'OK' to import it, or 'Cancel' to not import it.
